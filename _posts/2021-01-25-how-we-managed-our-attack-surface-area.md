This is a product validation case study for Plexicus. After 12 months of struggle, we finally validated a 5 step process to succesfully to manage our attack surface area.



Back in 2020, we read a lot of articles on how to reduce our attack surface area, however deep down we felt something was not right. 



There were some "Steps" that were Impossible to follow. 



I know what you're thinking, but our business model and the fast growing attacks made it very complex each time. 



In the end, we discovered that minimize it even further, it's just an illusion. That was our **Aha moment!** when we realized that our focus as technology leaders was to manage it, yeah....manage it as better as we can. 



A couple of questions came to our minds, the first one, and I think the most important was... **How do we start?**



## The beggining


We started by looking at our calendar. Time was scatterd as usual but we knew we needed to make time for more frecuent security assessments. 



Those security assessments were going to be the key to have a more updated perspective on our attack surface and how it was changing across time. 



To be honest, it was very difficult at first, sometimes we missed the date. And we totally understimated the time spent on the consolidation and analysis of that pile of information that we were creating. 



Some tools that were very helpful were: 



## Bringing order to the chaos



Well… We were busting our asses trying to come up with different strategies and methods to order things around. 



> The funny thing was that in our attempt to have more **peace of mind** by managing our attack surface, we actually lost our minds in the process. 



After many months with all of the information flowing in our minds, we were able to find ways to prioritize faster. 



*Quick hack*



And even, a way to automate the reporting and analysis phase. 



Things started to look up from there. 



## That's how we started to manage our attack surface area



1. Align your team 
2. Prioritize the discovery of new assets
3. Analyze the information further 
4. Focus on whats important and most impactful
5. Increase automation


### Case Study: Conclusion


Considering our initial goal was to sucessfully manage our attack surface, I’d call this a success.



It helped us create Plexicus and we could not be more proud.
